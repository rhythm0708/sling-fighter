## Gameplay Explanation ##

This game was designed for controller, but it will also work for keyboard and mouse. Use 'A' and the 'left stick' to pull back on the ropes, and let go to fire onto enemies. 'LB' and 'RB' are your sidesteps.

# Main Roles #

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer

As the producer, my primary responsibility is to manage the direction of our game and make sure that everyone understands their roles. It was important for me to avoid taking over the project and making every decision. Instead, I saw it as my responsibility to facilitate a reliable communication channel within our group and serve as a knowledgeable source of information about our project.

In preparation for this project, I carefully read over the [GameProject.md](https://github.com/dr-jam/GameplayProgramming/blob/master/GameProject.md) document provided to us by the professor. I wanted to ensure that we did not miss out on important aspects of the project and end up having to rush them. I talked to past students who had taken this class and looked over their `GameProject.md` documents linked in the [Project Groups Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OUz9atsn2HAFm9Wa97dMX5Q5Pg5Whuir-C6jLmuWleM/edit?usp=sharing). I jotted down important tasks and made sure that broad deadlines were covered. For example, I noted that the Gameplay Tester role needed to collect at least 10 pieces of feedback and the Press Kit & Trailer role could be done on itch.io (with a video published on YouTube). I made these decisions early so that our team had a clear direction and idea of what our timeline would look like.

I created a broad timeline overview for our [Initial Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C83mvbO1hN6x2nOqhr4wfracJC8zQ0X5KEP7wMynV6c/edit?usp=sharing) and later iterated on it to produce a [Gantt chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wmc_jXUsYLCNVoHWeGYUSb-fZbAOdSkT/view?usp=sharing) after receiving feedback from the professor. Some examples of other work that I did as Producer:

- _Meeting Notes_ - For this project, our team conducted a total of 7 meetings, 5 of which were formally documented. For each meeting, I prepared a document that contained Updates, (Meeting) Agenda, Tasks, and a Postmortem section. I did this for two reasons: 1) so that each meeting would be efficient and cover all necessary topics, and 2) so that team members who missed the meeting could read them to catch up. A folder of my meeting notes can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQh3dOM1LTEoZRAZfyugQAw6IgIBF4-z?usp=sharing).
- _Playtests + Playtest Notes_ - Our team conducted several formal playtests throughout this project. We did an in-person close play of games that were similar in concept to our initial game idea (see [Close Play Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1scHNr-ufXpqL_Jk3Jl3NwZVNuqxHBwZrDwwwx5BAPwI/edit?usp=sharing)). We did an alpha, beta, and full game loop playtest of our builds and took notes. A folder containing the documents that I designed for this purpose can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxBcECSqo5QJZQRb4cv_ltPRpya6PuLF?usp=sharing).
- _Meeting Miscellaneous_ - For in-person meetings and playtests, I booked meeting rooms and borrowed Xbox controllers. I would usually opt for Cruess 256 or Cruess 1107 and book it through the Tool Room (Cruess 101). I borrowed Xbox Controllers from the Alt-Ctrl Lab and informed relevant parties. I was also in charge of returning them after meetings.

# One final note

As Producer, I believe that it is important for every member of the team is fairly credited for the work that they did for this project. Our game has undergone an [alpha stage](https://github.com/rhythm0708/sling-fighter/tree/alpha-build), a [beta stage](https://github.com/rhythm0708/sling-fighter/tree/beta-build), and a [full game loop](https://github.com/rhythm0708/sling-fighter/tree/full-game-loop) stage. However, it is important to note that each stage looks quite different, meaning that a lot of work has gotten lost in the process. Below I have compiled a document listing the name of each member and their individual contributions. I hope that this is helpful for grading, and for clarifying the work that has been done by each person. I truly believe that each member of our team pulled their weight for this project, and I hope that this is evident in the final product.

## Wave System and Layout | Obstacle Behavior – Matvey Volkov

### Shift from Frontend Game Logic to Current Role
At the start of our project, our team decided to split up the role of Game Logic into two parts – frontend and backend. Having taken the former, I was initially tasked with integrating user-facing logic, such as player-enemy interaction and enemy behavior, as well as the wave system and layout. I was also in charge of handling However, with time, certain responsibilities of my role have been taken on by other members of my group, such as UI-related scripting (ex. start game upon button press in main menu), and a lot of my code was rewritten in the two refactors that were handled by the Movement/Physics/Game Feel team member.

The first of these introduced hitboxes and hurtboxes into the game, while my own code relied on 

[Talk about Alpha Build: factory design pattern, randomization of spawn locations]
[Talk about Beta Build: refactor, fixed spawn locations but randomization in terms of which enemies spawn there]
[Talk about Final Build: fixed wave layouts]

- From obstacles to obstacles, tools, and enemies, to obstacles and one main "enemy"
- Handling collisions before and after the refactor
- Handling obstacle behavior
- Setting up various wave systems and GameManager that starts out in an in-game state and transitions to end game
